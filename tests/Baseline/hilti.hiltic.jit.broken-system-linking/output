=== Uh oh ... C++ compilation failed ===

This is unexpected and should not happen. Please help us fix the issue
by opening a ticket at https://github.com/zeek/spicy/issues/new.

Please include the content of the following file with your report:

  "<...>/hilti-jit-error.log"

That file contains diagnostics from the C++ compiler. Please also
include your Spicy code that triggered this error, ideally reduced to
a small snippet still exhibiting the issue if you can.
