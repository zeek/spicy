This following summarizes the most important changes in recent Spicy releases.
For an exhaustive list of all changes, see the :repo:`CHANGES` file coming with
the distribution.

Version 1.4 (in progress)
=========================

.. rubric:: New Functionality

- Remove restriction that units used as sinks need to be ``public``

-  Uses ``ccache`` for C++ compilation during JIT if Spicy itself was configured to use ``ccache``

  Spicy spends a considerable amount of JIT time compiling generated C++ code.
  This work can be cached if neither inputs nor any of the used flags have
  changed so that subsequent JIT runs can complete much faster.

  We now automatically cache many C++ compilation artifacts with ``ccache`` if
  Spicy itself was configured with e.g.,
  ``--with-hilti-compiler-launcher=ccache``. This behavior can be controlled or
  disabled via the ``HILTI_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`` environment variable.

- GH-842: Add Spicy support for struct initialization.

.. rubric:: Changed Functionality

- GH-1074: ``%random-access`` is now derived automatically from uses and
  declaring it explicitly has been deprecated.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

- Prevent exception if cache directory is not readable.

- Propagate failure from ``cmake`` up to ``./configure``.

- GH-1030: Make sure types required for globals are declared before being used.

- Fix potentially use-after-free in stringification of ``stream::View``.

- GH-1087: Make ``offset`` return correct value even before parsing of field.

Version 1.3
===========

.. rubric:: New Functionality

- Add optimizer removing unused ``%random-access`` or ``%filter`` functionality

  If a unit has e.g., a ``%random-access`` attribute Spicy emits additional
  code to track and update offsets. If the ``%random-access`` functionality is
  not used this leads to unneeded code being emitted which causes unneeded
  overhead, both during JIT and during execution.

  We now emit such feature-dependent code under a feature flag (effectively a
  global boolean constant) which is by default *on*. Additionally, we added an
  optimizer pass which detects whether a feature is used and can disable unused
  feature functionality (switching the feature flag to *off*), and can then
  remove unreachable code behind such disabled feature flags by performing
  basic constant folding.

- Add optimizer pass removing unused sink functionality

  By default any unit declared ``public`` can be used as a sink. To support
  sink behavior additional code is emitted and invoked at runtime, regardless
  of whether the unit is used as a sink or not.

  We now detect unused sink functionality and avoid emitting it.

- GH-934: Allow ``$$`` in place of ``self`` in unit convert attributes.

.. rubric:: Changed Functionality

- GH-941: Allow use of units with all defaulted parameters as entry points.

- We added precompilation support for ``libspicy.h``.

- Drop support for end-of-life Fedora 32, and add support for Fedora 34.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

- Correctly handle lookups for NULL library symbols.

- Use safe integers for ``size`` functions in the runtime library.

- Make it possible to build on ARM64.

- Fix building with gcc-11.

Version 1.2
===========

.. rubric:: New Functionality

- GH-913: Add support for switch-level ``&parse-at`` and
  ``&parse-from`` attributes inside a unit.

- Add optimizer pass removing unimplemented functions and methods.

  This introduces a global pass triggered after all individual input ASTs have
  been finalized, but before we generate any C++ code. We then strip out any
  unimplemented member functions (typically Spicy hooks), both their
  definitions as well as their uses.

  In order to correctly handle previously generated C++ files which might
  have been generated with different optimization settings, we disallow
  optimizations if we detect that a C++ input file was generated by us.

.. rubric:: Changed Functionality

- Add validation of unit switch attributes. We previously silently
  ignored unsupported attributes; now errors are raised.

- Remove configure option ``--build-zeek-plugin``. Spicy no longer
  supports building the Zeek plugin/analyzers in-tree. This used to be
  available primarily for development purposes, but became challenging
  to maintain.

- Add environment variable ``HILTI_CXX_INCLUDE_DIRS`` to specify
  additional C++ include directories when compiling generated code.

- GH-940: Add runtime check for parsing progress during loops.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

- Fix computation of unset locations.

- Fix accidental truncating conversion in integer code.

Version 1.1
===========

.. rubric:: New Functionality

- GH-844: Add support for ``&size`` attribute to unit ``switch``
  statement.

- GH-26: Add ``%skip``, ``%skip-pre`` and ``%skip-post`` properties
  for skipping input matching a regular expression before any further
  input processing takes place.

- Extend library functionality provided by the ``spicy`` module:

   - ``crc32_init()/crc32_add()`` compute CRC32 checksums.
   - ``mktime()`` creates a ``time`` value from individual components.
   - ``zlib_init()`` initializes a ``ZlibStream`` with a given window bits argument.
   - ``Zlib`` now accepts a window bits parameter.

- Add a new ``find()`` method to units for that searches for a
  ``bytes`` sequence inside their input data, forward or backward
  from a given starting position.

- Add support for ``&chunked`` when parsing bytes data with
  ``&until`` or ``&until_including``.

- Add ``encode()`` method to ``string`` for conversion to ``bytes``.

- Extend parsing of ``void`` fields:

   - Add support for ``&eod`` to skip all data until the end of the
     current input is encountered.

   - Add support for ``&until`` to skip all data until a deliminator
     is encountered. The deliminator will be extracted from the stream
     before continuing.

- Port Spicy to Apple silicon.

- Add Dockerfile for OpenSUSE 15.2.

.. rubric:: Changed Functionality

- Reject ``void`` fields with names.
- Lower minimum required Python version to 3.2.
- GH-882: Lower minimum required Bison version to 3.0.

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

- GH-872: Fix missing normalization of enum label IDs.
- GH-878: Fix casting integers to enums.
- GH-889: Fix hook handling for anonymous void fields.
- GH-901: Fix type resolution bug in ``&convert``.
- Fix handling of ``&size`` attribute for anonymous void fields.
- Fix missing update to input position before running ``%done`` hook.
- Add validation rejecting ``$$`` in hooks not supporting it.
- Make sure container sizes are runtime integers.
- Fix missing operator<< for enums when generating debug code.
- GH-917: Default-initialize forwarding fields without type arguments.

.. rubric:: Documentation

- GH-37: Add documentation on how to skip data with ``void`` fields.
