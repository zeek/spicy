    in release mode in Spicy runtime driver. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix fiber result handling on abort. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-578: Fix glib decompression. Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add helper tool 'spicy-batch-extract' that extracts a single session out
    of a Spicy batch file. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add preliminary benchmark script `scripts/run-benchmarks`. See developer
    docs for more. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-1011 | 2020-11-05 17:09:53 +0100

  * GH-451: Support building on centos7 (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-1006 | 2020-11-05 12:56:56 +0000

  * GH-497: Add support for packet analyzers to Zeek plugin. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

    Zeek's master branch received support for adding low-level "packet
    analyzers" through plugins. This extends the Spicy plugin to support that.
    The documentation gained a new section explaining how to sue that.

    Note: This feature will not "officially" be supported until Zeek 4.0
    comes out (because we don't have Zeek master in CI).

  * Add --zeek-version argument to spicy-config. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Compile fix for GCC on Ubuntu. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-1001 | 2020-11-05 08:47:23 +0000

0.4.0-999 | 2020-11-04 15:18:45 +0100

  * Use a lightweight lambda class to callbacks executing on fibers. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Require all callbacks executing on fibers to return something. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Remove unused type_info::overload. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * GH-546: Model `TypeInfo` with a union instead of a `std::variant`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Update test baseline. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-993 | 2020-11-02 16:09:13 +0000

  * GH-159: Add some missing operator<< to runtime library. This now lets
    "-X trace" work for Spicy parsers. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-531: Make generated grammar symbols globally unique during Spicy
    codegen. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-176: Avoid infinite recursion when printing ASTs with self-recursive
    types. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    during cleanup of the parsed unit. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix error message in validator. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Aggressively compress package artifact for static build. (Benjamin Bannier,
    Corelight)

  * Remove packaging tasks for static CI build. Static builds tend to produce
    very large binaries which cannot reliably be compressed to be inside Cirrus
    CI's 1GB artifact size limit. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix documentation source link. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Consistently use `hilti::rt::filesystem` instead of `std::filesystem`.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * GH-540: Fix bug in regular expression parsing. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * GH-270: Fix for unit filters. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-500: Remove --include-linker option from driver. The better way
    to do all this is using "-l" to generate *just* the linker code,
    then compile the two together as two compilation units. (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-499: Provide has_label() method for enum values. Returns true
    if the enum maps to a known type value other than Undef. (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-556: Fix coercion of optional. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * GH-546: Use plain function pointers for type info accessors.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-946 | 2020-10-23 09:35:04 +0200

  * GH-522: Switch filesystem impl over to ghc::filesystem.

    Closes #522. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix use of uninitialized value when numbering unit fields.

    When were using a non-const member function to call a delegated base
    class constructor. Since at the point where the member function was
    called the derived class was not fully constructed, the members it
    accessed and mutated were uninitialized, we were reading from an unset
    variable, attempting to set it, and then overwrote its values when the
    member initializer was triggered (after the base class was constructed).
    This lead to unit field indices set to large value which were not usable
    down the line.

    We now delegate maintaining the field counter to a mixin class which can
    be constructed before the base class needing its state. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-939 | 2020-10-21 14:35:30 +0200

  * GH-521: Do not create copies when loading HLTO libraries. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-935 | 2020-10-12 07:13:46 +0000

  * Add support for new %print hook to Spicy units. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

    This allows a unit to customize its appearance when printed (or
    more generally: rendered into a string).

    Example:

        # cat test.spicy
        public type Test = unit {
            on %init   { print self; }
            f1: uint32;
            f2: uint8;
            on %done   { print self; }

            on %print  {
                local f1 = "-";
                local f2 = "-";

                if ( self?.f1 )
                    f1 = "%s" % self.f1;

                if ( self?.f2 )
                    f2 = "%s" % self.f2;

                return "%s|%s" % (f1, f2);
                }
        };

        # printf '\x00\x00\x00\x01\x02' | spicy-driver test.spicy
        -|-
        1|2

  * Allow customizing the string rendering of HILTI structs. If a
    struct provide a hook __str__(), that will be used instead of the
    built-in rendering of all its fields. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Make ID getter method constant. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-930 | 2020-10-09 18:10:13 +0200

  * Change `Stream::data` and `stream::View::data` to return a `Bytes`
    instead of a `string`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Test & CI updates. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    - Add a CI master step to validate Homebrew formula works.
    - Add missing Cirrus CI instance to Homebrew task.
    - Build compiler toolchain by default when configuring directly from CMake.
    - Bump default Zeek package in Docker images to more recent version.
    - Fix removal of build directory in CentOS 8 Docker container.
    - Increase sleep amount in test to make time measurable in CI.
    - Speed up test `spicy.types.unit.trimming`.

  * Help clang-tidy understand control flow in a couple of places.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-918 | 2020-10-06 12:23:08 +0200

  * Introduce the notion of Spicy-specific compiler options.

    So far, we only had codegen options for the HILTI compiler. This
    change allows Spicy to track options as well that control specifics of
    how the Spicy-to-HILTI code generations operates. Includes a couple of
    things:

            - As there's no appropiate global state on the Spicy side
              where we could story options easily, we extend the
              HILTI-side options struct with the notion of "auxiliary
              options", described by key/value pairs. Spicy can then store
              its options in there.

            - We derived a separate spicy::Driver from hilti::Driver to
              customize behaviour.

            - We introduce hooks into the hilti::Driver to add support for
              additional command line options. This remains a bit ad-hoc
              for now. At some point, we'll clean up of command-line
              handling generally works across the various tools, we have
              quite a bit of code duplication there right now.

            - This introduces a Spicy-side `-Q` option to record stream
              offsets during parsing. Right now, the option isn't having
              any effect yet, the implementation is going to come in a
              subsequent commit. spicy-dump's previous `-o` is renamed to
              `-Q` as well. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add an option to emit data offsets from spicy-dump.

    This patch adds an option `-o` to `spicy-dump` which can be used to
    trigger outputting of the stream offsets where unit fields were parsed
    from. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Make parser struct `__offset` member accessible from Values. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Store field offsets during parsing. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Make unit fields store their unit-wide field counter.

    Initially the parser will create unit fields as `UnresolvedField`s. This
    patch adds an `_index` field and accessor for this field which will
    be used to number all unit fields in the final, fully constructed and
    resolved unit so offsets can be computed. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Store whether a struct field is internal on type level. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix `type::struct_::Field::is*` methods to return booleans.

    These functions were previously returning optional field values which
    carry no information beyond being set or not. This patch changes these
    methods to return booleans instead. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fully type constructions of empty optional values. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Make `rt::Map::contains` `const`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-906 | 2020-10-06 08:11:53 +0200

  * GH-511: Fix order of flags in spicyc usage message.

  * GH-512: Fix typo in error message.

0.4.0-903 | 2020-09-28 18:42:38 +0000

  * Reorganize source code to allow for building the runtime library
    standalone. This adds a corresponding configure option:
    --build-toolchain=yes/no (default: yes)

  * Add configure option --disable-zeek-plugin-install to disable
    installing the Zeek plugin into Zeek's plugin path. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Add CMake module that enables Zeek plugins to build Spicy parsers.

  * Rename Zeek plugin to "_Zeek::Spicy" to work-around a loading
    order issue in Zeek. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Turn all 3rdparty code into proper git submodules. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Make using Gold linker default in CMake config. This is no change
    from when using "configure", but it changes the default when
    running "cmake" directly. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix configuration of Gold linker to apply to cmake modules as
    well. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Extend hilti-config and spicy-config with options to print the
    runtime's C++ include directories. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Avoid needing "which" in configure. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Disable a couple unit tests when running as root. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Fix compiler warning. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-890 | 2020-09-28 18:41:08 +0000

  * Port Zeek plugin to current Zeek master. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-508: Prevent loss of precision when codgening Time
    constructors. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * GH-503: Fix constructor `interval_ns` to accept unsigneds like
    documented. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Include `netinet/in.h` for `in[6]_addr` in `rt/address.h`.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix whitespace in spicy-driver batch usage string. (Benjamin
    Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-884 | 2020-09-08 07:39:00 +0000

  * Reimplement HILTI's stream type to substantially improve
    performance. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Move resolving of exceptions' backtrace symbols to point-of-use
    for improving performance. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix problem with fiber reuse. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix a unit test that's using multiple filters. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Add macOS work-around for problem with doctests' platform
    detection. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * When configured for debug mode, build tests without -O and link
    them against {hilti,spicy}-rt-debug. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-874 | 2020-08-27 14:21:57 +0200

  * Update parser lookup tables exclusively from `spicy::rt::init`.

    We previously were updating `globalState()->parsers_by_mime_type` from
    `registerParser` while `globalState()->parsers_by_name` was updated by
    `init`. This patch makes `init` the only function updating the parser
    lookup tables `parsers_by_name` and `parsers_by_mime_type`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Remove unintentional `return` in `rt::haveEod`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Avoid creating vain global state in `spicy::rt::{done,isInitialized}`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Reinitialize default parser when reinitializing spicy::rt library. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-861 | 2020-08-24 13:04:33 +0200

  * Diagnose invalid `zlib::Stream`s.

    When a `zlib::Stream` enters a failed state it cannot be reused
    anymore. Previously we would return empty data whenever such a stream
    was used again nevertheless. Since empty data is a valid result of
    decompressing non-empty input this leaves users with no good way to
    catch such scenarios after the fact.

    This patch modifies `zlib::Stream::decompress` to now throw an exception
    instead of returning valid but empty data. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-855 | 2020-08-24 10:56:17 +0000

  * Fix Cirrus CI file for Alpine 3.12. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-854 | 2020-08-24 08:41:23 +0000

  * Switch Dockerfile for Alpine from 3.11 to 3.12.

  * Compile code with debug information also when in release mode.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Compile the toolchain with -O3 instead of -O2. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Always link against thread library. The performance of some of our
    runtime code depends on whether the executable is linked against
    pthread or not. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-849 | 2020-08-24 08:39:14 +0000

  * Fiber runtime library updates. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    - Fix state tracking in fibers. When taking a fiber from the
      cache, we would reset its state ot INIT, which then led to
      restarting it from scratch instead of reusing the already
      running loop.

    - Add a function to fill the fiber cache with preinitialized
      instances.

    - Track number of fiber initialization in statistics.

    - Unify fiber debug logging.

0.4.0-843 | 2020-08-21 13:10:42 +0200

  * Consistently deal with `std::filesystem` still being experimental in hilti-rt. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-840 | 2020-08-21 10:04:02 +0200

  * Prevent use after free in `rt::base64::finish`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-833 | 2020-08-19 11:06:44 +0200

  * Add assertion catching out-of-bounds HILTI module access. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add check to prevent nullptr dereference in `hilti::rt::done`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add missing context cleanup in `hilti::rt::done`.

    We configure a `Context` owned by `GlobalState` in `hilti::rt::init`.
    Since we destruct that context in `hilti::rt::done` we also need to
    reset the context as we would otherwise leave a dangling refernence
    behind. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Call out gitlint in commit message style guidelines. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Remove guidance on not rebasing development branches. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add developer manual section on pre-commit linters. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add pre-commit linter for commit messages. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-819 | 2020-08-19 11:05:55 +0200

  * Explicitly set locale in centos Docker container.

    `hilti::rt::init` needs to be able to set the locale on the host system
    and will abort with a fatal error if it cannot do so. This patch makes
    sure this is possible in the centos-8 Docker container provided by us.

    Note: This already worked in BTests since its config file enforces the
    needed environment variables. This patch fixes it also for standalone
    usage of Spicy (and now e.g., the `locale` command emits no more
    errors). (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-817 | 2020-08-18 11:24:52 +0200

  * Add `hilti::rt::Library::symbol`.

    This patch adds a new member function `Library::symbol` which can be
    used to obtained a symbol from a specific library.

    While currently `Library` users just call `::dlsym` globally to obtain a
    symbol, this becomes ambigous if multiple libraries in the process image
    provide similarly named symbols. Instead they could hold handles to
    all interesting libraries and obtain symbols with the added function.
    With that we could also `::dclose` libraries in the `Library`
    destructor; we'll leave that change for a later point. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix warning potentially emitted from `rt::Library` destructor. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix format string in `rt::createTemporaryFile`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Extend error message when `rt::Library::save` fails. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Change CI job to use non-priviledged user.

    At least on ubuntu `root` seems to be able to modify even read-only
    directories which makes it hard to write tests checking handling of
    permission errors.

    Change the image used in CI to use a non-priviledged user instead. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Change directory used for ccache store in CI.

    We were originally using `/var/spool/ccache` which could require
    extended privileges to create. Switch over to use `/tmp/ccache` which
    should be easier to create even for unprivileged users. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Prevent `rt::Resumable::get` from leaking non-HILTI exceptions. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Make `hilti::rt::Resumable`'s operator bool explicit. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Consistently provide stringification for all exceptions. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add comparision operators to `rt::Backtrace`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix `to_string_for_print` for `DeferredExpression`.

    Since `DeferredExpression` is a template itself we cannot specialize the
    master template of the `detail` namespace; instead we need to provide an
    overload. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-798 | 2020-08-14 07:25:00 +0000

  * CI: Move Zeek package specs back into tasks to work around Cirrus
    issue, per https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/692.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-796 | 2020-08-14 07:20:31 +0000

  * Embed version information into HLTO files that encodes information
    about the HILTI version/config they were built with.  (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

    We use this for detecting (1) mismatches in the HITLI version used
    for building vs running, and (2) running an optimized HLTO file
    with a debug runtime. In both cases, the runtime will print a
    warning to stderr, but still proceed processing the library.

    Note that this is breaking change that will prevent HLTOs built
    with earlier versions from loading now.

  * Add option -U to tools that summarizes runtime resource
    consumption at termination. The measurement excludes time spent
    for startup/termination. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Use cout/cerr in debug logger instead of reopening them
    separately. Output can get mixed up otherwise if other places
    write to cout/cerr directly. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Update nlohmann-json and move to top-level 3rdparty directory.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-789 | 2020-08-11 07:47:30 +0000

  * Lots of new test coverage for HILTI runtime library: references,
    debug logger, configuration, safe-int, iterator, backtrace; along
    with releated fixed and cleanup. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-737 | 2020-08-11 07:39:31 +0000

  * Fix exception handling across library boundaries. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Allow limiting the "%port" of a unit to a specific direction.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    We now allow to add attributes `&originator`/`&responder` to a `%port`
    unit property to limit it to the corresponding direction of a session.
    When selecting a parser through `--parser <port>` in spicy-driver, one
    can now add `%orig` or `%resp` to the port to indicate the desired
    directionality. If one leaves that off, only parsers are selected that
    have no directionlity defined (i.e., just like it used to be).

  * Add batch input mode to spicy-dump. spicy-dump gains an option -F
    to process multiple interleaved input streams pre-recorded in a
    batch input file. The format of that file is described in the
    manual, and there's a Zeek script generating batch files from PCAP
    input traces.  (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * When naming a parser to use through "spicy-driver -p XXX", one can
    now also specifiy a port ("80/tcp") or a MIME type
    ("application/text") if the desired Spicy unit defines a
    corresponding property. See the documentation of spicy-driver for
    more. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Port Zeek plugin to new driver stateful matching API. (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-730 | 2020-08-11 07:38:44 +0000

  * Switch to Zeek 3.2.0 release packages for CI. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Add helper Makefile to build and run the CI docker image locallly.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-725 | 2020-08-05 12:44:26 +0200

  * Remove conversion of `rt::Time` to `bool`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix assignment operator for `rt::Union` of non-copyable types. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix format string error possibly triggered when adding Times and Intervals. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-716 | 2020-08-03 22:24:56 +0200

  * Make default-constructed `rt::Address` instances invalid. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Make `rt::Address` remember its address family.

    This class was previously unable to distinguish IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    with all bits sets to zero from each other. By explicitly storing its
    address family we are able to distinguish them, and can also preserve
    the address family across operations like masking. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Bump doctest to 2.4.0. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Validate prefix length inputs when constructing `rt::Network` values. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * GH-444: Port Zeek plugin to Zeek 3.2. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-323: Suppress bogus warning by Zeek when installing our plugin.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Extend EVT file syntax with @if/@else/@endif preprocessor directives.

    For now, we support one type of expression for "@if": a Zeek version check. Example:

        @if ZEEK_VERSION < 30200
        ....
        @else
        ....
        @endif (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    Also collecting all the Zeek includes into zeek-compat.h. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-691 | 2020-07-31 15:19:57 +0200

  * Emitted fully typed initializer lists in codegen.

  * Correctly handle flipping with zero valid bytes in `rt::integer::flip`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add additional precondition checks to `rt::integer::bits`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Consistently use `ntohX` type functions for `rt::integer::ntohX`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-681 | 2020-07-23 14:55:25 +0000

  * Fix potential invalid iterator deref in debug output. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add operator "bytes += uint8" for adding a single byte. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix missing filter end-of-input signal. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-423: Remove C{,XX}_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRS cmake flags. (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

    If this functionality is needed, set CXX_FLAGS instead during
    configure, e.g.:

        CXXFLAGS="-isystem /opt/rh/devtoolset-9/root/usr/include/c++/9" ./configure ...

    * Fix an operator's description.

  * GH-408: Remove "time + time" operator. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-404: Add `time_ns(X)` and `interval_ns(X)` expressions to
    instantiate values with nanosecond resolution. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Extend `{hilti,spicy}-config` with a `--dynamic-loading` option.
    This adapts `--ldflags` for applications that want to dynamically
    load precompiled parsers. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Make `&cxxname` usable for user code: The code generator now
    automatically adds prototypes for the corresponding C++ functions.
    To optionally disable that, a new attribute `&have_prototype` has
    been added. We also no longer require explicit global scoping for
    `&cxxname` IDs. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix joint usage of options `spicyc` options `-cKo`. This would end
    up saving only the linker code, not the combined parsing + linker
    code, in the specific output file. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-645 | 2020-07-16 06:33:23 +0000

  * Fix ill-defined order of internal HILTI plugin execution. (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

  * Remove JIT's {init,finish}Runtime() methods. They were no-ops
    already. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-634 | 2020-07-09 12:32:17 +0200

  * Lots of new & updates unit tests for the HILTI runtime. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-612 | 2020-07-08 15:21:20 +0000

  * GH-39: Add `spicy-dump`, a new standalone command line application
    that compiles and executes Spicy parsers on the fly and prints out
    the parsed information at the end in either a readable, custom
    ASCII format, or as JSON. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

        # echo "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0" | spicy-dump my-http.hlto
        MyHTTP::RequestLine {
            method: GET
            uri: /index.html
            version: MyHTTP::Version {
                number: 1.0
            }
        }

        # echo "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0" | spicy-dump -J my-http.hlto
        {"method":"GET","uri":"/index.html","version":{"number":"1.0"}}

  * GH-56: Add reflection API to libhilti for dynamic, runtime
    inspection of parsed units. This includes:

      * A "typeinfo(X)" expression for HILTI that, at runtime, wwill
        yield a pointer to a new `hilti::rt::TypeInfo`` struct
        describing the type of `X`, which can be a type or an
        expression.

      * `include/rt/type-info.h` builds out a comprehensive set of
        classes to describe HILTI types, and to access their values
        generically, at runtime.

      * A 3rd kind of host application-side parse function for public
        units. Spicy's driver's processInput() now uses that.

  * Change string rendering of ports to skip "Protocol::" prefix.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix bug in move assignment operator of ValueReference. (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add stringification for exception type. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add stringification for "any" type. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add missing &internal attributes to some codegenerated struct
    fields. This hides them from user visible output. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Add equality operator to regexp type. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add operator<< for regexp. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Support anonymous namespaces in C++ output. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add const version of vector iterator's dereference operator.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add -O0 to libhilti/libspicy for debug builds.  (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

0.4.0-572 | 2020-07-08 11:36:53 +0200

  * Fix parsing of `rt::Port` for out-of-range port values. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-552 | 2020-07-03 15:47:06 +0200

  * Switch `real::unpack` error reporting to use `rt::Result`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-549 | 2020-07-01 15:03:27 +0200

  * Remove unintended conversion of `rt::Result` to `bool`.

    Corelight)

  * Add tests of `rt::Interval` stringification. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add tests of `result::Error` stringification. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Add a DHCP analyzer. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix filename in getting started docs. (Dirk Loss)

  * Move reporting logic for --report-times so that it always executes
    when the HILTI-side driver destructs. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix header inclusion in Spicy plugin. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Remove unused `is_optional` type trait. (Benjamin Bannier,
    Corelight)

  * Enable translation of optional types on the Spicy-Zeek interface.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-525 | 2020-06-26 14:55:08 +0200

0.4.0-522 | 2020-06-24 22:24:34 +0200

  * Fix `hilti::rt::is_optional` so it applies to const and ref of optionals also. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-520 | 2020-06-24 06:59:04 +0000

  * GH-398: Remove duplicate spicy-driver CMake target. (Benjamin
    Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-518 | 2020-06-24 06:50:48 +0000

  * GH-140: Add "&requires"/"%requires" unit attribute/property.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    Fields may now use an attribute ``&requires=EXPR`` to enforce
    additional constraints on their values. ``EXPR`` must a be boolean
    expression that will be evaluated after the parsing for the field
    has finished, but before any hooks execute. If ``EXPR`` returns
    ``False``, the parsing process will abort with an error, just as
    if the field had been unparseable in the first place.

    One can similarly enforce conditions globally at the unit level
    through a property ``%requires = EXPR``, which will be evaluated
    once the unit has been full parsed, but before any ``%done`` hook
    executes. If ``EXPR`` returns ``False``, the unit's parsing
    process will abort with an error.

  * Add Doxygen output to Sphinx documentation. It's integrated into
    the "Read the Docs build". Locally, "make doxygen" will run it.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Clean up Sphinx custom extension. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)
    - Remove use of `sphinx.locale.l_`
    - Format with autopep8.

0.4.0-510 | 2020-06-23 16:16:43 +0200

  * GH-386: Add codegen for Spicy time difference. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-508 | 2020-06-22 06:03:34 +0000

  * Series of improvements for utility infrastructure (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)
      - Add tests for `util::escapeBytes`.
      - Add tests for some functions in `hilti::rt::util`.
      - Extend list of supported escape characters in hilti::rt escaping functions.
      - Fix `rt::split` for trailing delimiters.
      - Fix edge cases rt::atoi_n.
      - Fix typos in `hilti/rt/util.h`.
      - Make `rt::util::tuple_for_each` also work on rvalues.
      - Make documentation for `hilti::rt::rtrim` more specific.
      - Remove unused `escape_control` argument to `util::escapeBytes`.
      - Use raw character literals in some `hilti::rt::utils` tests.

  * Fix extraction of event priority in EVT files. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-496 | 2020-06-18 15:46:44 +0000

  * GH-381: Have the code generator fully declare enum types directly
    as part of the forward-declarations block. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-380: Corrections to tutorial. (Duffy Ocraven)

  * Adding short "Next Steps" section to tutorial. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-492 | 2020-06-17 10:41:13 +0200

  * Move hilti's `util` namespace into the `hilti` namespace. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-490 | 2020-06-17 10:36:36 +0200

  * GH-228: Prevent more overflows when working with hilti::rt Time and Interval (Benjamin Bannier,
    Corelight)
    - Change `hilti::rt::Interval` to use safe integers.
    - Change `hilti::rt::Time` to use safe integers.
    - Fix some typos in `hilti/base/util.h`.
    - Remove hilti-rt-tests dependency on hilti library.
    - Reorganize test cases for `hilti::util`.

0.4.0-484 | 2020-06-16 07:15:25 +0000

  * Add new tutorial chapter. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add Zeek-side option "Spicy::enable_print" to control whether the
    output of Spicy-side "print" output is shown. Default is off
    (which is a change in behaviour compared to previous versions).

  * Clean up representation of type arguments and function calls in
    auto-generated operator reference. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Make the target stream of hilti::print() configurable. Default
    remains standard output. Leaving it unset will silence
    hilti::print(). (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Do not use use "using X === ..." for forward-declaring struct
    types in C++ output, as that could accidentally pull in IDs from
    outer namespaces. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix scanner for accepting comment lines at end of file without
    terminating newline. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-477 | 2020-06-15 07:36:43 +0000

  * GH-293: Fix precedence of "in" operator. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-325: Fix a couple of segfaults in scope builder when hitting
    invalid code. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Update spicy-driver usage message. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-344: Type check assignments and fix constness propagation.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-345: Validate type of &default expressions. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

  * Add more debug information about constness to AST. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

0.4.0-467 | 2020-06-15 07:18:03 +0000

  * Redo testing of `hilti::rt::Stream` and clean up implementation (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)
    - Add Doxygen documentation to `rt::Stream`.
    - Add `begin` and `end` methods for `rt::list::Empty`.
    - Add additional nullptr checks when acessing `rt::Stream` iterator chunks or contents.
    - Fix escaping of `rt::Stream` and `rt::View` in stringification
      to ensure all non-printable byte sequences are escaped.
    - Make `rt::stream::View` iterators be safe by default.
    - Prevent nullptr dereference in `rt::Stream` iterator `chunk` and `content`.
    - Remove `rt::Stream::safe_[begin|end]`.
    - Remove `rt::stream::View::safe_[begin|end]`.
    - Remove `safe_begin` and `safe_end` extension points.
    - Remove unused `Chunk::begin`.
    - Remove unused `rt::Stream::chain` function.
    - Remove unused `rt::Stream::compare` functions.
    - Remove use of unsafe iterators in a few places.
    - Rename `rt::iterator::safe_range` to drop the 'safe' qualifier.
    - Add lots of tests new cases, and reorganize exists test cases.

  * Add `begin` and `end` methods for `rt::list::Empty`. (Benjamin
    Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-430 | 2020-06-12 08:07:16 +0200

  * Reenable some already passing clang-tidy checks. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-428 | 2020-06-12 08:06:23 +0200

  * GH-274: Unbreak build for when other Spicy headers are already installed.

    If Spicy headers were already installed into a path somewhere in the
    include lookup, we could have found the same header twice, preferring
    the installed header over the one of the current checkout. This could
    have lead to diagnostics about duplicate definitions since due to use of
    `#pragma once` in our headers the compiler would not have detected that
    a header was already included (and even if it would have detected this,
    it would have included the incorrect header).

    This patch adds include paths from the current checkout before any
    system paths.

0.4.0-426 | 2020-06-09 17:16:13 +0000

0.4.0-417 | 2020-06-08 10:26:32 +0000

0.4.0-411 | 2020-06-05 07:28:40 +0000

  * GH-361: Fix construction of vectors with element types that
    provide default values. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-365: Zeek plugin: Catch if more parameters are given in an EVT

  * Remove branch name from Cirrus CI emails due to API limitations.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-406 | 2020-06-04 09:14:27 +0000

  * GH-354: No longer allow dashes inside identifiers. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-350: Restrict parsing of attributes and properties to avoid
    ambiguities. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Clean up the expression mode in the Spicy Bison parser. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    This comes with a couple of grammar changes to avoid ambiguitues:

        - "new X" no longer allowes full expressions for X, just values or
          identifiers.

        - Switch cases that use look-ahead now also need to be introduced
          with an arrow, e.g.:

               switch {
                   -> a: A;
                   -> b: B;
                   -> c: C;
               };

  * Reduce resources requested from Cirrus. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Make iterators into vectors ordered. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * GH-343: Fix duplicate evaluation of if-condition when used with

  * Add validation check for initializations that use the ID that's
    currently being declared. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix mailing list links in README. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-393 | 2020-06-04 08:41:28 +0200

   - Add test cases for `rt::Bytes` member functions.
   - Fix construction of `rt::Bytes` from string and charset.
   - Fix handling of undefined byte order in ByteOrder conversions to integers.
   - Prevent throwing `std::out_of_range` from `rt::Bytes::extract`.
   - Add additional safety to `bytes::Iterator`.
   - Made some `rt::Bytes` methods `const`.
   - Remove rvalue overload of `rt::Bytes::str`.

  * Fix ADL for `rt::to_string`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Fix `rt::util::split` for empty delimter case. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-364 | 2020-06-04 08:40:25 +0200

    integration and standalone plugin builds. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

0.4.0-348 | 2020-05-27 13:03:22 +0200

  * GH-335: Add http_all_headers() event to HTTP EVT file.

    The event isn't used anywhere by default in Zeek, but it's a nice
    example of transforming Spicy information on the fly to match a
    Zeek-side event signature.

  * Fix JIT-less build of Zeek plugin. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-309 | 2020-05-20 12:35:36 +0000

  * GH-299: Support compiling the Zeek plugin without JIT support.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    If configured with `--disable-jit`, the Zeek plugin will now still
    be built and will support loading pre-compiled HLTO files. The
    plugin will have dependencies only on system libraries, and hence
    can be installed on systems that don't have the Spicy libraries
    available.

    There's also a new configure option `--disable-jit-for-zeek` that
    disables JIT support just for the Zeek plugin, creating the same
    dependency-free result.

  * GH-83: Add standalone tool spicyz to precompile analyzers for
    Zeek. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    This replaces the previous shell wrapper around Zeek, meaning that
    we can now precompile Zeek analyzers without actually relying on
    having a Zeek binary itself available. (We continue to require
    access to the Zeek development headers.)

    As a bonus feature, the new spicyz comes with an option "-c
    <prefix>" that, instead of producing a fully compiled HLTO, just
    writes out all the generated C++ code into files, each named
    "<prefix>-<module ID>.cc". This goes along way towards supporting
    compiling Spicy analyzers statically into an application, similar
    to how BinPAC is being used (GH-72).

  * Fix shell commands in `docker/Makefile`. (Benjamin Bannier,
    Corelight)

0.4.0-226 | 2020-05-06 15:12:52 +0000

  * Apply a set of tweaks to specifics of &size. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

    - We now enforce that a field consumes all its &size characters of
      input, unless explicitly overridden where a types allow for that
      (as, e.g., "bytes" does with an additional &eod).

    - We slightly change semantics for parsing bytes: A &size of zero
      will now set the field an empty bytes value; it used to leave
      the field unset.

    - Document that &size works with all fields (which it already
      did).

    - Clean up the implementation of &size.

  * GH-289: Do not perform look-ahead parsing for vectors fed from
    &parse-from/at. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-203 | 2020-05-03 15:37:30 +0000

  * GH-265: Require unit properties to end with a semicolon. We were
    inconsistent with that. Note that this will break existing code
    that wasn't using the semicolons, including some examples from the
    documentation (which have been updated). For example, it's now
    `%filter;` instead of `%filter`. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    Corelight)

  * GH-262: Allow signs in intN/uintN() constructors. (Robin Sommer,

  * GH-196: Reject container constructors with inconsistent types, and
    coerce elements once the type is known. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-187 | 2020-04-30 10:26:13 +0000

  * Improve `vector` implementation. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

        - Remove broken `rt::Vector::set`.
        - Fix includes of `hilti/rt/types/vector.h`.
        - Add unit test for a couple of `hilti::rt::Vector` methods.`

  * GH-272: Document precompiled MacOS packages. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.4.0-179 | 2020-04-29 15:15:14 +0200

    block rendering (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.4.0-173 | 2020-04-29 08:20:21 +0000

  * Report column information in error messages. Locations are emitted
    as `<line>:<character>` so that e.g., the second character on the
    fourth line would be displayed as `4:2`. This extends to ranges as
    well which look e.g., like `1:1-2:30`. (Benjamin Bannier,
    Corelight)

0.4.0-171 | 2020-04-28 19:08:50 +0000

  * Add a section to the development manual on the structure of the
    runtime libraries. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * GH-226: Add CI setup for building published Docker images. This
    patch adds an `update_dockerhub` target to `docker/Makefile`,
    which builds, tests and uploads images to Dockerhub. It also
    changes the Dockerfiles in `docker/` back to include Spicy build
    commands, so that they become practically self-documenting
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight).

  * GH-222: Output changes to make rendered ASTs easier to parse
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)
