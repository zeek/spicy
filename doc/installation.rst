Installation
=============

Spicy can be installed from pre-built binaries (Linux, macOS) or with
Homebrew (macOS), executed via Docker containers (Linux), or built
from source (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD):

.. contents::
    :local:

We generally aim to follow `Zeek's platform policy
<https://github.com/zeek/zeek/wiki/Platform-Support-Policy>`_ on which
platforms to support and test.

.. note::

    Most of the installation options discussed in this chapter do
    *not* include the Zeek plugin for Spicy. We recommend installing
    the plugin through Zeek's package manager; see its
    :ref:`installation instructions <zeek_installation>`.

Pre-built binaries
------------------

.. _prebuilt_linux:

Linux
~~~~~

We provide pre-built Spicy binaries for a range of Linux
distributions, both for the current release version and for
development builds made from the Git ``main`` branch.

These binary artifacts are distributed as either DEB or RPM packages
for the corresponding distribution; or, in a couple cases, as TAR
archives. To install the binaries, download the corresponding package
and execute one of the following:

DEB packages
    .. code::

        # dpkg --install spicy.deb

RPM packages
    .. code::

        # rpm -i spicy.rpm

TAR archives
    The TAR archives need to be unpacked into ``/opt/spicy``. Any
    previous installation must be removed first::

        # rm -rf /opt/spicy && mkdir /opt/spicy
        # tar xf spicy.tar.gz -C /opt/spicy --strip-components=1

The binaries may require installation of additional dependencies; see
the ``Dockerfile`` for the respective platform for what's needed.

macOS
~~~~~

.. _homebrew_macos:

Homebrew
^^^^^^^^

We provide a Homebrew formula for installation of Spicy. After
`installing Homebrew <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`_ add the
Zeek tap::

    # brew tap zeek/zeek

To install the most recent Spicy release version, execute::

    # brew install spicy

To instead install the current development version, execute::

    # brew install --HEAD spicy

.. _prebuilt_macos:

Pre-built binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide TAR archives with pre-built binaries for the following
macOS versions:

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center

    * - macOS
      - Release Version
      - Development Version

    * - Catalina (10.15)
      - :package-release-tgz:`TAR <macos_catalina>`
      - :package-dev-tgz:`TAR <macos_catalina>`

    * - Big Sur (11)
      - :package-release-tgz:`TAR <macos_big_sur>`
      - :package-dev-tgz:`TAR <macos_big_sur>`

The TAR archives need to be unpacked into ``/opt/spicy``. Any previous
installation must be removed first. To prevent macOS from quarantining
the files, you should download and unpack via the command line::

    # curl -L <link-per-above> -o spicy.tar.gz
    # rm -rf /opt/spicy && mkdir /opt/spicy
    # tar xf spicy.tar.gz -C /opt/spicy --strip-components 1

For JIT support, these binaries require an Xcode installation.

.. _docker:

Using Docker
------------

We provide :ref:`pre-built Docker images <prebuilt_docker>` on Docker
Hub. The Spicy distribution also comes with a :ref:`set of Docker
files <docker>` to create base images for all the supported Linux
distributions that put all of Spicy's dependencies in place. We'll walk
through using either of these in the following.

Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You first need to install Docker on your host system, if you haven't yet.

Linux
^^^^^

All major Linux distributions provide Docker. Install it using your
package manager. Alternatively, follow the official
`instructions <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`__.

macOS
^^^^^

Install `Docker Desktop for Mac
<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac>`_ following the official
`instructions <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install>`__.

.. note::

    Docker Desktop for Mac uses a VM behind the scenes to host the
    Docker runtime environment. By default it allocates 2 GB of RAM to
    the VM. This is not enough to compile Spicy or Zeek and will cause
    an error that looks something like this::

        c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)
        Please submit a full bug report,
        with preprocessed source if appropriate.
        See <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-7/README.Bugs> for instructions.

    This is due to the VM hitting an out-of-memory condition. To avoid
    this you will need to allocate more RAM to the VM. Click on the Docker
    Icon in your menubar and select "Preferences". Click on the "Advanced"
    tab and then use the slider to select 8 GB of RAM. Docker Desktop will
    restart and then you will be ready to go.

.. _prebuilt_docker:

Using pre-built Docker images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We publish the following Docker images to the ECR public gallery:

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center

    * - Spicy Version
      - Image name/tag
      - Source

    * - Release
      - `zeekurity/spicy <https://gallery.ecr.aws/zeek/spicy>`_
      - :repo:`Dockerfile <ci/Dockerfile.dockerhub>`

    * - Development
      - `zeekurity/spicy-dev <https://gallery.ecr.aws/zeek/spicy-dev>`_
      - :repo:`Dockerfile <ci/Dockerfile.dockerhub>`

These images include Zeek, the :ref:`Spicy plugin <zeek_plugin>` for
Zeek, and the `Zeek analyzer collection
<https://github.com/zeek/spicy-analyzers>`_ as well, so you can use
them to try out the full setup end-to-end.

To run the release image, execute the following command::

    # docker run -it public.ecr.aws/zeek/spicy:latest

Spicy is installed in ``/opt/spicy`` on these images. The development
image is updated nightly.

.. _dockerfiles:

Build your own Spicy container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can build base images for your own Spicy setups through the
:repo:`Docker files <docker>` coming with the distribution. These
images do *not* include Spicy itself, just the dependencies that it
needs on each platform, both for a source build and for the using the
corresponding binary packages. (The images do include Zeek, but not
the Zeek plugin.)

To build an image, go into Spicy's ``docker`` directory and run
``make`` to see the container platforms available::

    # cd docker
    # make

    Run "make build-<platform>", then "make run-<platform>".

    Available platforms:

        alpine-3.12
        centos-8-stream
        debian-10
        [...]

To build and run a container image based on, for example,
Debian 10, execute::

    # make build-debian-10
    # make run-debian-10

.. note::

    The primary purpose of these Docker files is creating the
    foundation for our CI pipelines. However, they also double as
    verified installation instructions for setting up Spicy's
    dependencies on the various platforms, which is why we are
    describing them here.

.. _building_from_source:

Building from source
--------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build Spicy from source, you will need:

    - For compiling the toolchain:

        * A C++ compiler that supports C++17 (known to work are Clang >= 9 and GCC >= 9)
        * `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_  >= 3.15
        * `Bison <https://www.gnu.org/software/bison>`_  >= 3.0
        * `Flex <https://www.gnu.org/software/flex>`_  >= 2.6
        * `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ >= 3.4
        * `Zlib <https://www.zlib.net>`_ (no particular version)

    - For testing:

        * `BTest <https://github.com/zeek/btest>`_  >= 0.66 (``pip install btest``)
        * Bash (for BTest)

    - For building the documentation:

        * `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master>`_  >= 1.8
        * `Pygments <https://pygments.org/>`_  >= 2.5
        * `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_  (``pip install sphinx_rtd_theme``)

In the following we record how to get these dependencies in place on
some popular platforms. Please :issue:`file an issue <>` if you have
instructions for platforms not yet listed here.

Linux
^^^^^

See the corresponding :ref:`Dockerfiles <dockerfiles>`.

macOS
^^^^^

Make sure you have Xcode installed, including its command-line tools
(``xcode-select --install``).

If you are using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_::

    # brew install bison flex cmake ninja python@3.8 sphinx-doc
    # pip3 install btest sphinx_rtd_theme

If you are using `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org>`_::

    # port install flex bison cmake ninja python38 py38-pip py38-sphinx py38-sphinx_rtd_theme
    # pip install btest

FreeBSD
^^^^^^^

See the :repo:`prepare script <ci/prepare_freebsd.sh>` coming with
the Spicy distribution.

Building Spicy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the code::

    # git clone --recursive https://github.com/zeek/spicy

The short version to build Spicy is the usual process then::

    # ./configure && make && make install

However, you may want to customize the build a bit, see the output
``./configure --help`` for the available options. In particular, you
can use ``--prefix=/other/path`` to install into something else than
``/usr/local``.

The final ``configure`` output will summarize your build's
configuration.

.. note::

    For developers, the following ``configure`` options may be
    particular useful:

        - ``--enable-ccache``: use the ``ccache`` compiler cache to speed up compilation
        - ``--enable-debug``: compile a non-optimized debug version
        - ``--enable-sanitizer``: enable address & leak sanitizers
        - ``--generator=Ninja``: use the faster ``ninja`` build system instead of ``make``

    Using Ninja and ``ccache`` will speed up compile times. On Linux,
    compiling will also be quite a bit faster if you have the "Gold
    linker" available. To check if you do, see if ``which ld.gold``
    returns anything. If yes, ``configure`` will automatically pick it
    up.

Once you have configured Spicy, running ``make`` will change into the
newly created ``build`` directory and start the compilation there.
Once finished, ``make test`` will execute the test suite. It will take
a bit, but all tests should be passing (unless explicitly reported as
expected to fail). Finally, ``make install`` will install Spicy
system-wide into the configured prefix. If you are installing into a
non-standard location, make sure that ``<prefix>/bin`` is in your
``PATH``.

.. note:: You can also use the Spicy tools directly out of the build
   directory without installing; the binaries land in ``build/bin``.

To build Spicy's documentation, run ``make`` inside the ``docs/`` directory.
Documentation will then be located in ``build/doc/html``.

.. _parser-development-setup:

Parser development setup
------------------------

In order to speed up compilation of Spicy parsers, users can create a
cache of precompiled files. This cache is tied to a specific Spicy
version, and needs to be recreated each time Spicy is updated.

To precompile the files execute the following command::

    # spicy-precompile-headers

.. note::

    By default the cache is located in the folder
    ``.cache/spicy/<VERSION>`` inside the user's home directory. This
    location can be overridden by setting the environment variable
    ``SPICY_CACHE`` to a different folder path, both when executing
    ``spicy-precompile-headers`` and Spicy toolchain commands.
